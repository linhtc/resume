The Resume of TCL, A "Fullstack" Developer!
===========================================

Hi there, my legal name is Tran Cong Linh but I prefer TCL or Leon Tran.
This is my web resume. I'm looking for a job, but I'm only interested in Saigon or jobs where I could be remote from here.

Who is he?

* A passion for programming languages.
* A polyglot who enjoys the commonalities and contrasts of each platform.
* Loves tuning systems for performance and stability.
* A cyclist, "poet", "singer" and "best" football player.

I have many years of PHP development experience. Though I am a Swift in iOS and Java in Android as well. 
I enjoy enabling more stable performant software in any way I can.

In my spare time, I play with ESP32 of Espressif, 
Arduino Board and my project called Linhomes.
And I enjoy seeking a new way to address old problems by my knowledge.
