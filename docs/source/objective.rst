My Objective
============

I was born in a countryside where wifi was very low and many people didn't know computer.
I think that I shall never change the world like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg 
or many CEOs of Fortune 500 technology companies used to do.
But I have three goals for myself. And after I left recent company!
It's time to change my world.

For 30 years old
----------------
I'll work for a company and make anything I can do in that.
Why do I want to work there?

* A professional environment, friendly to promote all abilities, creativity with colleagues.
* To create multiple valuable products for the community and develop for high-tech.

Someone asked me what I thought about the "professional environment"?
In my opinion, it's space where I can sleep without negative feedbacks from customer.
I often bring tasks to home. But I don't want give bugs to you. It is terrible.

For 35 years old
----------------
I'll move to Japan or Silicon Valey to understand How do they make a best product?
What do I can do and prepair to start with it.

For 40+ years old
-----------------
I'll "change the world"!
