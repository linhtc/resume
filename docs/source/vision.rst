Vision
======

I often read about future and trend of technology like `Future Forecast <http://www.quantumrun.com/future-timeline/2025/future-timeline-subpost-technology>`_. 
I always wonder:

* Where am I now? and
* Where do I want to go? and
* What do I need to do now?

I have many ideas and `Linhomes <https://github.com/linhtc/linhomes>`_ is one of them. It's not a long term of tomorrow. 
Many companies had done with this in decades ago. But It still useful and ready to make the "Big Bang" in Industry 4.0. 
And What does make it different from other types of idea? Because many family need to upgrade their home to smarter and convinience. 
But the price is expensive for that. It's goal for this project. "Give it for everyone".

If You're wondering What happen when he looking for job? Yeah, I need to work, it's a important part of my life. 
I'll start with this like something I wrote in :ref:`hashtag-objective` in future.
